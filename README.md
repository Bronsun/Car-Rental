## Description

The main goal of our project was to create an easy and user-friendly car rental application.
    Our program offers an easy rent system for the client and employee. You are able to rent,
    add, delete or check available vehicles in the system. Unfortunately one half of application is in Polish and one in Engilsh. I will try my best to change it fully on english in near future.
